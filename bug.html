<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML error: using a non-standard attribute on an element.</p><pre><code>&lt;div data-invalid-attribute="value"&gt;Some content&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>Browsers will generally ignore non-standard attributes, but in some cases, it might lead to unexpected behaviour.  Certain frameworks or libraries might rely on these attributes, causing issues during development or in specific circumstances.  The error might not be immediately obvious during testing or development but could cause problems later on.</p>
